# react-interview - Task 1
We want to implement a list component with a search text that receives a list of items and renders them.

Build a search page that fetches data from our mock server (api/listAPI.js) and displays the results. 
Use this file [src/api/data.json](../src/api/data.json) which contains the relevant mock data.
